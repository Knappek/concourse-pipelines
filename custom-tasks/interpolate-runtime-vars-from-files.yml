# this task will read one or more files and save the content to a variable
# 
platform: linux

inputs:
- name: custom-tasks
- name: config
  # the template of the runtime vars file with (()) parameterized variables

- name: files # contains files to be interpolated into runtime-vars-tmpl

- name: vars # variable files to be made available, which will be used to store the interpolated vars file

outputs:
  - name: vars
    # the runtime-vars file generated from runtime-vars-tmpl

params:
  CONFIG_PATH:
  # - Required
  # - config filepath to be interpolated

  VAR_FILEPATH_MAPPING:
  # - Required
  # - space-separated array of "VariableKey:FilePath" that will be interpolated.
  #   example: my_var:certificate.pem will be translated into:
  #            om interpolate -c [...] -v my_var="$(cat files/certificate.pem)"
  #            This will interpolate the variable "my_var" used in CONFIG_PATH with the value from the file files/certificate.pem

  VARS_OUTPUT_PATH:
  # - Required
  # - the path to the folder where the runtime-vars.yml should be stored

  RUNTIME_VARS_FILENAME: runtime-vars.yml
  # - Optional

run:
  path: custom-tasks/custom-tasks/interpolate-runtime-vars-from-files.sh
